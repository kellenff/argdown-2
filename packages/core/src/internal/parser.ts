/**
 * Generates a documentation page for a parser based on its current state after

 * 1. Attempting to parse the provided arguments to determine the current state
 * 2. Generating documentation fragments from the parser's current state
 * 3. Organizing fragments into entries and sections
 * 4. Resolving command usage terms based on parsed arguments
 *
 * For sync parsers, returns the documentation page directly.
 * For async parsers, returns a Promise of the documentation page.
 *
 * @param parser The parser to generate documentation for
 * @param argsOrOptions Optional array of command-line arguments that have been
 *        parsed so far, or a {@link ParseOptions} object for annotations.
 *        When a `ParseOptions` is passed here, the `options` parameter is
 *        ignored.  Defaults to an empty array when omitted.
 * @param options Optional {@link ParseOptions} for customizing parsing
 *        behavior.  Only used when `argsOrOptions` is an array or omitted.
 * @returns For sync parsers, returns a {@link DocPage} directly.
 *          For async parsers, returns a Promise of {@link DocPage}.
 *          Returns `undefined` if no documentation can be generated.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const parser = object({
 *   verbose: option("-v", "--verbose"),
 *   port: option("-p", "--port", integer())
 * });
 *
 * // Get documentation for sync parser
 * const rootDoc = getDocPage(parser);
 *
 * // Get documentation for async parser
 * const asyncDoc = await getDocPage(asyncParser);
 * ```
 * @since 0.9.0 Updated to support async parsers.
 * @since 0.10.0 Added optional `options` parameter for annotations support.
